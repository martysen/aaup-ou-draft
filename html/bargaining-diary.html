            <p>
              We are pleased to announce that as of 12:20am on Saturday,
              September 4th, 2021, the two sides have reached an agreement at
              the table. Accordingly, the Bargaining Team is calling an end to
              the work stoppage effective immediately. Saturday classes will be
              held as scheduled. Faculty are encouraged to reach out to their
              students as soon as possible. We would like to thank all our
              members for the amazing outpouring of solidarity and support. The
              agreement will be presented at multiple General Membership
              meetings in the coming weeks as per our association bylaws.
              Details will follow shortly.

            <p>
              The two sides have continued to negotiate through the day with
              minimal progress. Language issues on the faculty tuition waiver
              and health care benefits remain key sticking points. The parties
              have exchanged proposals on the remaining economic issues but
              still no noteworthy progress has occurred. The parties are on a
              short break from the table as the mediator had a brief conflict
              but all will return at 7pm to continue negotiations.

            <h2>Bargaining Report Sept. 3rd 9:35 am</h2>
            <p>
              Yesterday's negotiations proceeded slowly. While there are a small
              number of items remaining on the table, they are hugely important.
              The vast majority of the day was spent defending Oakland's attacks
              against the faculty tuition waiver. This gift our faculty give one
              another is a crucial element of our Faculty Agreement and our
              members have told us loud and clear that we must defend the right
              to provide that gift to one another. Oakland attempts to alter the
              language of this waiver have created problems where none existed
              and open the door to erosion of the contract clause. Oakland's
              proposed language is sloppy, vulnerable to misinterpretation, and
              reflective of their obtuse refusal to recognize the way the
              benefit was designed to work. Oakland initially proposed lowering
              their contribution to full-time faculty health care from 95% to
              80%, a shocking reduction. In previous contracts, the Association
              has given in other areas of the contract in order to maintain that
              health insurance contribution rate. While Oakland's proposals now
              have that reduction to a still-painful 90% starting in the second
              year of the contract, that change was made in connection with
              further reductions to offered salary raises. In other words,
              Oakland's move to make our members parallel with other employees
              on campus comes WITH a lowered salary offer. The total effect on
              our members is unacceptable. Salary increase offers from Oakland
              remain at less 2% a year, well below anything that can be
              considered cost of living.

            <p>
              After 16 and a half hours, we have reached the end of this session
              with no new contract agreement. Several crucial economic issues
              remain. We recognize that both parties need a short break.
              Negotiations will resume at 10am. The work stoppage remains in
              effect. Your presence on the picket lines today, 9/3, will be
              greatly appreciated.

            <p>
              We have no progress to report. Oakland continues to challenge the
              contractual language regarding the faculty tuition benefit. They
              have not addressed the bulk of the economic issues today. We
              remain at the table.

              The two sides continue to negotiate. Much of today's session has
              been focused on discussing the faculty tuition waiver. We remain
              at the table and intend to do so throughout the evening.

              As of 1 o'clock Thursday morning, the two sides have not reached
              an agreement. The contract has expired. Additionally, on
              Wednesday, the Association filed an unfair labor practice charge
              regarding the Oakland's failure to bargain the impact of the COVID
              vaccine mandate on our members. Therefore the Bargaining Team has
              exercised its authority and called for a work stoppage, effective
              immediately. We will return to the bargaining table at 10 am.

              the parties have been bargaining since noon. Progress has been
              made on some issues. Many economic issues remain unresolved:
              including but not limited to full-time faculty raises, full-time
              faculty health insurance, special lecturer pay increases, special
              lecturer health insurance, as well as tuition waivers and
              retirement benefits for all bargaining unit faculty members. We
              are currently continuing to bargain in good faith.
