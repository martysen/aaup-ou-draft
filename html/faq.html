            What are the real benefits of AAUP membership?

            <p>
              Historically at Oakland, the strength of the union has provided
              all OU faculty with professionally competitive salaries and
              benefit packages. Further, any faculty member who feels s/he has
              been treated unfairly by the administration has recourse to AAUP
              support. The AAUP can intercede and/or mediate in any number of
              ways, from attempting to generate informal dialogue right on up to
              the filing of a formal grievance. The AAUP, most often through the
              Executive Director, can advise faculty members on many issues,
              offering a perspective which may not be available within the
              faculty member's immediate department. Also, the AAUP continually
              strives to insure a professional environment which promotes and
              protects the academic freedom of all faculty. Members of the AAUP
              participate in the selection of AAUP officers and negotiating
              teams, and can participate in the decisions that guide the
              direction of the union.

            <p>
              If you have a concern that may be an issue covered by the Faculty
              Agreement, you can contact the AAUP Office. You can call the
              office at (248) 370-2005; fax a question to (248) 370-2004; or
              email a question to the Executive Director. If you prefer to visit
              the AAUP office, it is located on the second floor of Pryale Hall
              Room 201. Pryale Hall is located at the eastern end of the large
              parking lot behind O'Dowd Hall. It is across the street from the
              Heating Plant and the Recreation Center parking lot.

            What types of problems can the AAUP help with?
          </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              The most obvious problems which the AAUP can help with involve
              contract violations. Faculty members should be somewhat familiar
              with the contract and the rights and responsibilities defined in
              it. The officers of the AAUP, most often the Executive Director,
              are readily accessible to explain the language in more detail. If
              you are denied a leave, phased retirement, sabbatical, or any
              formal request, or if a formal request for any of the above is not
              responded to in timely fashion, the AAUP can initiate a
              discussion, determine whether a contract violation has occurred,
              and if a contract violation has occurred, file a grievance. More
              broadly, though, the AAUP may be able to help you whenever you
              feel you have been mistreated by the administration.

            What is a grievance and how do I file one?
          </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              In any complex institution personnel problems will occur from time
              to time. In universities these might include conflicts between
              faculty and students, faculty and faculty, and faculty and
              administrators. The formal grievance process delineated in Article
              XXIV of the 2003-2006 Faculty Agreement exists to resolve
              conflicts between faculty and administrators. The University,
              College, schools, and departments have grievance procedures to
              address the other two types of personnel conflicts involving
              faculty with students or other faculty. For every type of problem
              an effort should be made by all parties to solve the problem at
              the lowest possible level which requires effective communication
              including careful attentive listening. The contractual grievance
              process, as well as others, is designed to protect the less
              authoritative party against arbitrary decisions by the more
              authoritative party that could jeopardize the former's rights to
              fair treatment. The Article XXIV grievance procedure is limited to
              resolution of disagreements and problems faculty “may have in
              relation to employment by Oakland, arising from the application,
              or interpretation of this Agreement.” The Faculty Agreement
              defines who can teach credit courses; perform professional library
              service; the process and criteria for awarding academic titles,
              reviewing, reappointing, and promoting faculty; methods and levels
              of compensation of faculty; conditions and processes for layoff
              and recall of faculty; discipline and discharge procedures; fringe
              benefit entitlements of faculty; conditions and policies for paid
              and unpaid leaves; rights and responsibilities of faculty and
              chairpersons; and past practice. Past practices include the
              principles of academic freedom, and existing procedures, policies,
              and practices as outlined by the constitutions of the University
              Senate, schools, and college. Discrimination by reason of age,
              race, creed, marital status, color, sex, religion, national
              origin, citizenship, sexual orientation, political affiliation, or
              handicap is prohibited. If any faculty member believes the
              administration has violated any provision of the faculty agreement
              including but not limited to those outlined above, he/she should
              contact the Grievance Officer or AAUP Chapter Executive Director.
              These officials will discuss the potential contract violations and
              explore informal means for resolution of the problem. Should such
              informal means fail, the Grievance Officer will file a formal
              grievance on your behalf. All faculty have the right to file a
              grievance whether or not the AAUP officials agree there has been a
              contract violation. Administrative reprisals against anyone filing
              a grievance are violations not only of our contract but also of
              state and federal law. Since department chairs are members of the
              bargaining unit, faculty may not file formal grievances against
              department chairs. It may still be possible to grieve the dean for
              failure to properly supervise a chair. TIME LIMITS. Grievances
              must be filed in a timely manner. Grievances must be filed within
              30 calendar days of the incident to be grieved or within 30
              calendar days after the faculty member of the Association should
              have known thereof and no later than 90 calendar days of the
              incident. Once the Association has been notified of a potential
              grievance, it may be able to obtain extensions to the formal
              filing deadline to explore informal resolution methods. STEPS IN
              THE GRIEVANCE PROGRESS. The formal grievance process has three
              steps. A step one hearing is usually held by a staff member of the
              Office of Academic Affairs. Whether the Grievance Officer filed
              the grievance on your behalf or you filed it, you are entitled to
              have and strongly urged to have a representative of the
              Association present at the Step One hearing. Within 10 days of the
              hearing the administration will provide a written response. If the
              grievant is not satisfied with the Step One response, he/she may
              ask the Association to request a Step Two hearing. This request
              must be made within 10 days of receipt of the Step One Response. A
              Step Two hearing is usually conducted by representatives of the
              Office of Academic Affairs and one academic dean. The Association
              Grievance Officer will present the case for the grievant although
              the grievant is usually present. The administration will provide a
              written response within 10 days of the hearing. If the Association
              is not satisfied with the Step Two response, it may request
              binding arbitration. For tenure arbitration the arbitrator will be
              selected from the panel of arbitrators listed in paragraph 183 of
              the Faculty Agreement. For other grievances the arbitrator will be
              chosen by mutual agreement between the Association and the
              administration or the procedures of the America Arbitration
              Association or the Federal Mediation Conciliation Service.
              Arbitrations are scheduled by mutual agreement between the
              Association, administration, and arbitrator and last from a few
              hours to a few days. The arbitrator has 30 days to render a final
              decision.
